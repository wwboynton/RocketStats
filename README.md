This is the In-Game overlay, rank image is dynamic, giving Rank, Division, MMR, MMR Changed, Win, Losses, and Win Streak. You can change images that are display, but changing them in **\rocketleague\Binaries\Win64\bakkesmod\RocketStats\RocketStats_images**.

File used are:
- loose.png (for the red cross)
- win.png (for the trophy)
- crown.png (for the medal, used to be a crown)
- All the rank image, but keep their name as is, it will break the plugin otherwise

### OBS Overlay

This is an example of the OBS Overlay, you can display same information on your stream, and style it your way, using custom video and font. 

NOTE: The rank images have been changed to higher-resolution ones, with dimensions of 1381x1381. Adjust your overlay accordingly, or images may be cut off.

#### Installation
You can find the example background video by [Rimey](https://twitter.com/Rimey_) here : [Download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ye_Iq-1lK_dkQKQvk_Ia5EwbTNEiViG/view?usp=sharing)

The font use for this overlay is [Azonix Regular](https://www.dafont.com/azonix.font)

Make a "media source" check "Local file" and point to where you stored the video "RL_overlay.mov" or your own overlay.

Keep in mind that "RL_overlay.mov" is an example of what you can do, let your imagination create the overlay you love ! ;)

To display data such as win, loose, streak and MMRChange, make a "Text" source check "Read from a file"

To do this, the text files are located in your folder "bakkesmod/RocketStats"

To display the image of your rank you need to make a "Browser" source to configure like this:

![Rank](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/681760010392436836/764024258443477002/wzE_RR.png)

The file is in your "bakkesmod\RocketStats\RocketStats\RocketStats_images" folder and is names is "rank.html"

You can animate your stream while boosting !

Use a Browser source

![Boost](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/681760010392436836/764024263471923210/FkrpCU.png)

The file is in your "bakkesmod\RocketStats\RocketStats\RocketStats_images" folder and is names is "boost.html"

Of course it is possible to change the logo displayed to put yours, you need two videos in the format ".webm" one named "boost.webm" and one "noboost.webm".
